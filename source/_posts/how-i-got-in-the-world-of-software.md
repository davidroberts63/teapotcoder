Now, this is the story all about how
My life got flipped-turned upside down
And I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there
I'll tell you how I became a coder in the world of software
<!-- more -->
In Oklahoma City, from a small computer store
On a XT dual floppies where I learned my trade
Hackin' out, thinkin', learnin' the bits
And writin' a B-ball card app inside BASIC

When I sent in a card to get some college info
Called me up saying 'hey we think we can help you'
I got in one small job a friend thought I'd do well
And I said, "This is the work that with life is swell"

I typed out some VB for an inventory app
The users said it's awesome, better than other smack
I went on to PHP.....left and never looked back
But I learned a lot in there, this world of software

I left that first place after years of six or seven
And said to the next place "Yeah I can help ya"
Looked inside seeing imposter syndrome start
Still building with my co-workers in the world of software
