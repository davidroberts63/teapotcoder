About a month ago I finished a contribution to the [PowerArgs][] project and [wrote about it](/fork-pull-powerargs). A week or two later I thought it would be a great idea to make my first screen cast about it.

The [PowerArgs][] project is a very nice one and I plan on contributing more to this project as I hope you will consider the same. I also hope you consider using it in your projects where you need command line parsing.

I learned a lot from this first screen cast of mine. I am going to look into [Screenflow](http://www.telestream.net/screenflow), [iShowU](http://www.shinywhitebox.com/ishowu-v1), or [Camtasia](http://www.techsmith.com/camtasia) depending on how often I do screencasts. Also trying to figure out how to handle it with my Windows VM on the Mac. Any suggestions are appreciated.

Thanks for watching and hope you have a great day! Come back again.
