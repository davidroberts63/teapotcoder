I'll be presenting [ServiceStack][] at the April meet up of the [OKC Developers Group](http://www.okcdg.org).<!--more-->The presentation starts at 11:30 with food and drink included (usually pizza). It lasts about an hour and there are drawings for prizes at the end. So come to hear about [ServiceStack][] and to talk to other developers.
