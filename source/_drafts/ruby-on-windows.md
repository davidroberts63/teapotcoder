### Initially for a 10 minute lighting talk for Ruby user group in February.

### Points to cover
* Ruby environment manager?
* THe download
* Ruby CI tool friendliness
* Powershell/Bash impendences
* Gems maybe depending on Linux environment usage?
* Editors
* Performance considerations?
* Try out some of the skeleton generator stuff. Rails app generator for instance.
* IronRuby, JRuby?
* O.O This looks like the perfect example ;-)

### The adventure
* https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/ looking for Windows download
* https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/  RubyInstaller
* Quick check on chocolatey.org: It has 2.1.6 and something called 'Pik' for windows ruby version management
* Now looking for offical ruby version management: RVN and rbenv
* https://rvm.io/
  * https://rvm.io/rvm/install: Note at bottom about installing on Windows. Leading to:
  	* http://blog.developwithpassion.com/2012/03/30/installing-rvm-with-cygwin-on-windows/ (from 2012)
	* It talks about cygwin/mysgit. But I want to see how far I can go without that.
